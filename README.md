LD32 SLAM JAM

We made a game for the "Jam" section of Ludum Dare in 72 hours.
You could describe it as a room-based 3d puzzle game.

The goal is to use the right object(s) to solve the puzzle(s) in the room.
It is imaginatively called, "The Right Tool For The Job".

(I recommend the windows version as opposed the increasingly unsupported Unity Web Player).
